# Sprint Challenge: Hash Tables and Blockchain

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint, we learned how hash tables combine two data structures to get the best of both worlds and were introduced into the fascinating world of blockchains. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by solving algorithms in Python using hash tables and add another key feature to your blockchain.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in Python and your command of the concepts and techniques in related to hash tables and blockchains.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

This sprint challenge is divided up into three parts:  Hash tables coding, blockchain coding, and a short interview covering parts of hash tables and blockchain.

## Interview Questions

Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:
* What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?

To access an element of an array the run time complexity is constant.
To add an element to the front all the elements have to be shifted, the time complexity is O(n)
To remove an element from the front of the array, the time complexity is O(n)
To add an element to the back of the array is O(1)
To remove an element from the back of the array is o(1)



* What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?

The worst case scenario of extending the storage size of the array is O(n)


Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?

In a blockchain, each block is chained to each other like in an array. Each block contains the details of the block such as the transactions in each block, time the block was generated, hash of the previous block.

The first block is the genesis block. Each subsequent block is generated after a proof of work is validated as per the designated algorithm. Once the proof is valid, a new block is generated and then chained to the previous block. 

The data in the blocks is organised such that there is no central repository, whereas all the data can be deciphered by looking at the data in each of the blocks.

 
Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?

Proof of work functions such that, using the data in the block a hash is generated, this hash needs to be such that it satisfies an algorithm requirment. As soon as the proof is satisfied, a new block is added to the blockchain and the next block which is generated has to satisfy the proof based on the newly generated block. Due to the nature of such requirement, any attacker needs to constantly update with the latest block or else he will be left behind.

As the proof is structured this way, an attack is possible, only if the network is controlled by the attacker. If the attacker controls the network, then he can write the block he wants, that way the new blocks can be added only by the attacker.


## Project Set Up

#### [Hash Tables]

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through two algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the .py skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with make tests.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the hashtable.py file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).

*You may not use any advanced, built-in Python functions to solve these problems.*

#### [Blockchain]

For the blockchain portion of the challenge, you will be writing code for a new miner that will solve a different Proof of Work algorithm than the one we have been working with.

Your goal is to mine at least one coin.  Keep in mind that with many people competing over the same coins, this may take a long time.  By our math, we expect that an average solution should be the first to find a solution at least once in an hour or two of mining.
